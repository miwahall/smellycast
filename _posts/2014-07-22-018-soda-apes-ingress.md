# Ingress

Lastly we forgo talking about our favorite new things to talk about [Ingress](https://www.ingress.com/). For those of you that don’t know what Ingress is, it is a game, maybe, maybe its something more? Maybe its a secret cult that tracks everything we do and manipulates humankind? Maybe. Maybe not? Anyways you should go and download it and start playing. And you better join the Resistance because if you don’t Phil will most likely never talk to you again. You’ve been warned. You can download it on your Andrids or Ifins. Feel free to contact us in com if you have any q’s. Mike is @Scatolax and Phil is @TheyCallMePhil.
