We are proud to present episode 17 of Smellycast! In this episode we review some sodas. Phil reviews [AriZona Beverages’ Soda Shaq](http://www.drinksodashaq.com/) and Mike reviews [Fentimans Cherrytree Cola](http://www.drinkfentimans.com/#!cherrytree-cola/c1m57). For our video games segment we talk about Watchdogs and [Grand Theft Auto V being rereleased for Playstation 4 and Xbox One](http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52261/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Coming-this-Fall-to-PlayStation-4-Xbox). Yay!

Television takes up a good chunk of this episode. We talk about our excitement about having [Suits](http://www.usanetwork.com/suits) back as well as the incredible [Game of Thrones](http://www.usanetwork.com/suits) season finale. Amazing!
